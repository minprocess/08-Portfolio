# 08-Portfolio

## Description
Portfolio of the web pages I programmed myself or as part of a team. I used MaterializeCSS for this page. It is supposed to mobile responsive.

## Installation
This web page has a single html file, a single css file and a single js file. MaterialCSS and jQuery are linked with the CDN website, <cdnjs> (https://cdnjs.com). No APIs are used.
